## Understanding the Java Execution Process
- `Main.java` is a source code file written in Java.
- During compilation, `Main.java` is transformed into a `ByteCode.class` file (a non-human-readable format).
- The generated ByteCode is then executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), converting it into machine code.

## Key Terminologies
### JDK (Java Development Kit)

- The Java Compiler (javac)
- Java libraries and tools
- The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
A runtime environment that provides:
- Libraries and class files required to run Java applications
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
An abstract computing machine responsible for:
- Loading and interpreting ByteCode
- Converting ByteCode into machine code
- Managing application memory and garbage collection
